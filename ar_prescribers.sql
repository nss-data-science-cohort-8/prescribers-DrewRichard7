-- 4.a. For each drug in the drug table, return the drug name and then a column named 'drug_type' which says 'opioid' for drugs which have opioid_drug_flag = 'Y', says 'antibiotic' for those drugs which have antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y', and says 'neither' for all other drugs. **Hint:** You may want to use a CASE expression for this. See https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-case/

--4. b. Building off of the query you wrote for part a, determine whether more was spent (total_drug_cost) on opioids or on antibiotics. Hint: Format the total costs as MONEY for easier comparision.

-- 7. The goal of this exercise is to generate a full list of all pain management specialists in Nashville and the number of claims they had for each opioid. **Hint:** The results from all 3 parts will have 637 rows.


--7.a. First, create a list of all npi/drug_name combinations for pain management specialists (specialty_description = 'Pain Management') in the city of Nashville (nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'), where the drug is an opioid (opiod_drug_flag = 'Y'). **Warning:** Double-check your query before running it. You will only need to use the prescriber and drug tables since you don't need the claims numbers yet.

SELECT p.npi AS npi, d.drug_name AS drug
FROM prescriber AS p
CROSS JOIN drug AS d 
WHERE p.specialty_description = 'Pain Management'
	AND p.nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
	AND d.opioid_drug_flag = 'Y';


--7.b. Next, report the number of claims per drug per prescriber. Be sure to include all combinations, whether or not the prescriber had any claims. You should report the npi, the drug name, and the number of claims (total_claim_count).

SELECT 
	rxer.npi,
	d.drug_name,
	SUM(rx.total_claim_count)
FROM prescriber AS rxer
LEFT JOIN prescription AS rx
USING(npi)
CROSS JOIN drug AS d
WHERE rxer.specialty_description = 'Pain Management'
	AND rxer.nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
	AND d.opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
GROUP BY rxer.npi, d.drug_name
ORDER BY rxer.npi DESC;

	
--7.c. Finally, if you have not done so already, fill in any missing values for total_claim_count with 0. Hint - Google the COALESCE function.

SELECT 
	rxer.npi,
	d.drug_name,
	COALESCE(SUM(rx.total_claim_count), 0) AS total_claim_count
FROM prescriber AS rxer
CROSS JOIN drug AS d
LEFT JOIN prescription AS rx
USING(npi)
WHERE rxer.specialty_description = 'Pain Management'
	AND rxer.nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
	AND d.opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
GROUP BY rxer.npi, d.drug_name
ORDER BY rxer.npi DESC;
